Just place this application into a directory where cgi-scripts are evaluated.
The webserver needs the permission to write into the directory!

Copy config.rb.sample to config.rb to start with a default configuration and make
sure, that the webserver is allowed to write into the directory and can execute
ruby + bzr.
