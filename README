=== Installation ===
1. Place this application into a directory where cgi-scripts are evaluated.
2. Copy config_sample.rb to config.rb to start with a default configuration.
3. The webserver needs the permission to write into the directory 
4. You have to build a .mo file from the .po file in order to use the 
   localization. Type:
      make
   This requires libgettext-ruby-util, potool, and make to be installed.
   If this does not work for you, you can download the .mo files from another
   server, e.g., put http://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/locale/de/dudle.mo
   into the directory locale/de.
5. In order to let access control work correcly, the webserver needs 
   auth_digest support. It therefore may help to type:
     sudo a2enmod auth_digest
6. In order to get atom-feed support you need ruby-ratom to be installed.
     sudo gem install ratom
